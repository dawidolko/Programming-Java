# Bank ATM Simulation in Java

Welcome to the Bank ATM Simulation project! This Java-based repository offers an immersive and realistic simulation of a bank ATM system. Whether you are a Java enthusiast or interested in finance, this project provides an excellent opportunity to delve into the world of banking and ATM operations.

## Description
The Bank ATM Simulation project aims to create a fully functional and user-friendly simulation of a bank ATM system. Using Java programming, we will develop an interactive interface that mimics the real-world ATM experience. Users will be able to perform various banking operations, check their account balances, make deposits, withdraw cash, and more, all within a secure and intuitive environment.

## Key Features
User Authentication: Implement a secure login system where users must enter their PIN to access their accounts, ensuring confidentiality and security.

Account Management: Allow users to create new accounts, update their account details, and manage their financial information.

Balance Inquiry: Provide users with the ability to check their account balances and view their transaction history.

Cash Withdrawal and Deposits: Enable users to withdraw cash from their accounts and make deposits into their chosen accounts.

Transaction History: Keep track of user transactions and provide an option to review past activities.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to handle edge cases and ensure a smooth user experience.

## How to Get Started
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bank-ATM-Simulation-Java.git
```
Familiarize yourself with the existing codebase and the design of the ATM system.

Begin implementing the various features, starting with user authentication and account management.

Test the functionalities thoroughly to ensure seamless operations and proper error handling.

## System Requirements
JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine.

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans for a seamless coding experience.

## Contributions and Support

# Java Database Project
Welcome to the Java Database Project! This repository is dedicated to building a robust and efficient database application in Java. With this project, you can create, manage, and manipulate data with ease.

## Description
The Java Database Project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for working with databases in Java. It offers functionalities to connect to different database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more. This project provides a user-friendly interface to interact with databases, making data storage and retrieval seamless and efficient.

## Key Features
Database Connectivity: The project offers built-in drivers and APIs to connect to various DBMS.

Data Manipulation: Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on database records.

Query Execution: The project supports executing custom SQL queries for complex data retrieval.

Schema Management: Easily create, alter, and manage database schemas.

Data Import and Export: Users can import data from external sources and export data in various formats.

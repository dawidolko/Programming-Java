# Scientific Committee Management System in Java
Welcome to the Scientific Committee Management System project in Java! This repository is dedicated to creating an efficient and effective system for managing scientific committees. Whether you're a researcher, conference organizer, or committee member, this application will streamline the review process and enhance collaboration.

## Description
The Scientific Committee Management System project aims to develop a robust application for managing scientific committees responsible for reviewing research papers, conference proposals, and other scholarly work. This system will simplify the submission, review, and decision-making processes, enabling committees to efficiently evaluate and select high-quality submissions.

## Key Features
Paper Submission: Researchers can submit their papers and proposals directly to the scientific committee through the system.

Review Management: The application will assign submissions to committee members for review and provide tools for reviewing and providing feedback.

Decision Process: The system will facilitate the committee's decision-making process, allowing members to vote, discuss, and finalize acceptance or rejection.

Conference Planning: For conference committees, the system will assist in organizing event logistics, scheduling presentations, and managing attendees.

Notification System: Users will receive timely notifications for important updates, deadlines, and committee activities.

User Roles: The system will have different user roles, such as researchers, committee members, and administrators, each with specific permissions.

Reporting: The application will generate reports on submission statistics, review outcomes, and conference attendance.

## How to Get Started
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-Java/Projects/Komis.git
```
Set up your Java development environment, including JDK (Java Development Kit) and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.

Explore the existing codebase and familiarize yourself with the project's structure and functionalities.

Start implementing new features or enhancing the user interface to improve the scientific committee management system.

## Contributions and Support
Contributions to the Scientific Committee Management System project are highly encouraged! Whether you want to add new features, improve the system's performance, or fix bugs, your contributions will be valuable.

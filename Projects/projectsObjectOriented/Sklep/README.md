Welcome to the Java Store Management System project! This repository is dedicated to creating a comprehensive and efficient store management system. Whether you're a store owner, manager, or employee, this application will streamline various store operations and enhance the overall shopping experience.

## Description
The Java Store Management System project aims to develop a user-friendly and feature-rich application for managing all aspects of a store, including inventory, sales, customer data, and more. The system will serve as a centralized platform for store personnel to handle day-to-day operations effectively.

Customer Database: Users can maintain a database of customer information, allowing for personalized services and loyalty programs.

Sales Analytics: The system will generate detailed reports and analytics on sales performance, best-selling products, and revenue trends.

User Roles and Permissions: Different user roles (e.g., manager, cashier) can be defined with specific access permissions.

Discounts and Promotions: Store personnel can apply discounts, promotional offers, and special deals on products.

Stock Alerts: The application will provide real-time alerts when stock levels for certain products are running low.

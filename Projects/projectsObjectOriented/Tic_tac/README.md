# Java Tic Tac Toe Game
Welcome to the Java Tic Tac Toe Game project! This repository is dedicated to developing a classic Tic Tac Toe game implementation in Java. Get ready for some strategic fun as you play against an AI opponent or challenge your friends to see who can claim victory in this timeless game.

## Description
The Java Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple yet engaging project that allows players to experience the thrill of Tic Tac Toe right on their computers. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where players can take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who successfully forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their symbols wins the game.

## Key Features
Single-Player Mode: Play against an intelligent AI opponent that employs a strategic algorithm to provide a challenging experience.

Two-Player Mode: Challenge your friends or family members to play Tic Tac Toe with you on the same computer.

Interactive GUI: Enjoy a user-friendly and visually appealing graphical interface that makes playing the game enjoyable.

Winning Condition: The game automatically detects a winning combination and announces the winner at the end of the game.

Game Replay: After the game concludes, players have the option to start a new game or replay the current game.

## How to Play
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.git
```
Set up your Java development environment, including JDK (Java Development Kit) and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Eclipse or IntelliJ.

Launch the game and select the desired mode: Single-Player or Two-Player.

In Single-Player mode, you will play against the AI opponent, while in Two-Player mode, you can play with a friend.

Click on the empty cells of the 3x3 grid to place your symbol. The first player to align three of their symbols wins the game.

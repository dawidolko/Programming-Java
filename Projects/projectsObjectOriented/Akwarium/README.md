# Aquarium Simulation in Java

Welcome to the Aquarium Simulation project! This Java-based repository brings the fascinating underwater world to life through a realistic aquarium simulation. Whether you are a Java enthusiast or a nature lover, this project offers a unique opportunity to dive into the captivating realm of aquatic life.

## Description
The Aquarium Simulation project aims to create a dynamic and visually appealing simulation of an aquarium environment. Using Java programming, we will construct a virtual aquarium filled with colorful fish, plants, and interactive elements. This project will provide an immersive experience, allowing you to observe the behavior of marine life and interact with the virtual ecosystem.

## Key Features
Fish Species: Implement various fish species, each with distinct characteristics, swimming patterns, and behaviors. Watch them interact with one another and explore their surroundings.

Aquatic Plants: Populate the aquarium with a diverse array of aquatic plants, adding vibrancy and realism to the underwater environment.

User Interaction: Allow users to interact with the virtual aquarium through simple controls. Feed the fish, create bubbles, or change the aquarium's settings to influence the behavior of the marine life.

Realistic Physics: Apply realistic physics and animations to the fish and plants to simulate their movements and interactions convincingly.

Customization: Enable users to customize the aquarium, such as adjusting water conditions, adding decorative elements, or introducing new fish species.

## How to Get Started
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-Java/Projects/Akwarium.git
```
Familiarize yourself with the existing codebase and the structure of the aquarium simulation.

Start adding new fish species, implementing interactions, or enhancing the visual aspects of the aquarium.

Experiment with different parameters and settings to create a diverse and dynamic underwater ecosystem.

## System Requirements
JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine.

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans for a seamless coding experience.

## Contributions and Support
Contributions to the Aquarium Simulation project are encouraged and highly appreciated. If you have ideas for improving the simulation or want to add new features, feel free to open a pull request.

If you need assistance or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out via email or GitHub.

Get ready to embark on an exciting journey into the mesmerizing world of aquarium simulation in Java! Happy coding and enjoy the serene underwater experience!

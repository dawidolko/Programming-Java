# Scientific Microwave Oven Simulation in Java
Welcome to the Scientific Microwave Oven Simulation project in Java! This repository is dedicated to creating a sophisticated simulation of a microwave oven that can be used for scientific research and experimentation. Whether you're a physicist, engineer, or cooking enthusiast, this application will provide valuable insights into microwave heating processes.

## Description
The Scientific Microwave Oven Simulation project aims to develop an accurate and versatile simulation of a microwave oven's behavior. This simulation will model the interaction between microwaves and various food items, allowing users to explore heating patterns, cooking times, and other microwave-related phenomena.

## Key Features
Microwave Modeling: The application will simulate the emission and propagation of microwave radiation within the oven.

Food Interaction: Users can input different food items with varying properties, and the simulation will predict their heating behavior.

Heating Patterns: The system will visualize the distribution of microwave energy inside the oven and how it affects the food.

Cooking Time Prediction: The simulation will estimate the cooking time for specific food items to achieve desired heating levels.

User Interface: The application will provide an intuitive graphical interface for easy interaction and data visualization.

Experimentation Platform: Researchers can use the simulation as a virtual lab to conduct microwave-related experiments.

Data Analysis: The system will generate detailed reports and data analysis based on simulation results.

## How to Get Started
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-Java/Projects/Microfala.git
```
Set up your Java development environment, including JDK (Java Development Kit) and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.

Explore the existing codebase and familiarize yourself with the project's structure and functionalities.

Start implementing new features or enhancing the user interface to improve the scientific microwave oven simulation.
